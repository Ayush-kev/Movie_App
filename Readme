Movie Explorer - https://ayush-kev.github.io/Movie_App/

Movie Explorer is a modern web application that allows users to discover and search for movies in real-time. The app fetches data from a public movie database API and displays movies with their poster, rating, and a short overview. The project is fully responsive, interactive, and designed with a clean, professional UI.

Features
Displays popular movies on page load
Real-time search functionality
Color-coded movie ratings for quick visualization
Responsive grid layout that works on all screen sizes
Smooth hover effects on movie cards
Handles errors gracefully if API fails or no results are found

Technologies Used-
This project is built using:
HTML5 for the page structure
CSS3 for styling and responsive design
JavaScript for DOM manipulation, API calls, and interactivity
Fetch API to get movie data from The Movie Database (TMDB) API

Project Structure - 
The project files are organized in a clean folder structure:
index.html - the main HTML file
style.css - contains all styles for layout, cards, and responsive design
script.js - handles fetching movie data, rendering movie cards, and search functionality

How It Works - 
When the page loads, the app fetches the most popular movies from the TMDB API and displays them in a responsive grid. Each movie card shows the poster image, title, rating, and a brief overview. Ratings are color-coded to give users a quick idea of how good the movie is. Users can search for specific movies using the search bar. If no movies are found, the app displays a friendly message.

Setup Instructions

Clone or download the project folder.
Replace the placeholder API key in script.js with your own TMDB API key.
Open index.html in a browser to see the app in action.

Why This Project Is Useful ?
This project demonstrates the ability to integrate APIs, manipulate the DOM dynamically, and build responsive, user-friendly interfaces. It is suitable for showcasing front-end development skills in a portfolio or for practice in JavaScript and web development.
